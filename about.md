I'm a web developer using mostly Ruby on Rails,Ember.js, and React.  I love to learn new languages and techniques as they help me grows as a developer. I find it to be a truly enjoyable experience creating applications that other people use to improve their lives.  How cool is it that it's possible to create something from my office and someone on the other side of the Earth can use it??
