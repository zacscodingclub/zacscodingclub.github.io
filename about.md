I'm a software engineer that works across the full stack using Ruby on Rails,
EmberJS, and React. I love to learn new languages and techniques as each new
concepts provides a new perspective and help me grow as a developer. I find it
to be a truly enjoyable experience creating applications that other people use
to improve their lives. How cool is it that it's possible to create something
from my office and someone on the other side of the Earth can use it??
