I'm an engineer that enjoys working across the stack of an application to make an impact. I've been both a software and devops engineer that works on web apps, CLI apps, CI/CD pipelines, and even the code that generates the infrastructure that is used by the web applications and the CI/CD pipelines. I've experienced technical scaling problems and worked to understand how to overcome those problems.
