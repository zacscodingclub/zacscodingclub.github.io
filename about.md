I'm a web developer studying Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Angular.js, and other fun web technologies.  I say "fun" because it truly is an enjoyable experience creating applications that other people use to improve their lives.  How cool is it that I can create something in my kitchen and someone on the other side of the earth uses it??
