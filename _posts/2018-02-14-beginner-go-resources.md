I've been learning Go for a couple of months and have accumulated a ton of bookmarks and links on the subject. Recently I decided to prune through those and figure out which ones I found the most helpful when getting started. Below are some of my favorites that helped me in a wide variety of topics from completely getting started, to understanding some of the more complex topics specifically related to the most powerful features of Go.
